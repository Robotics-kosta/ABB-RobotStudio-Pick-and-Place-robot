## Implementation of kinematic control to a robot with differential drive.

When you run the script you can switch between the manual and automatic mode. In manual mode you can set the linear and angular velocities of the robot. In the auto mode you can set a target coordinates and desired orientation of the robot. The controller drives the robot to the target with the predefined constant linear velocity. It also moves backwards if the target is behind the robot.
